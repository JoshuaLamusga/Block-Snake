## How to Play
Win by collecting by as many dots as possible without running off-screen, into yourself, or others.

### Dots
Dots disappear after 10 seconds. There is always at least one dot, but sometimes a second may appear. Collecting dots speeds up the game.

### Multiplayer
1st player is red, 2nd blue, 3rd green, and 4th yellow.
When a player loses, they turn black and act as an obstacle for others. The last snake alive wins. If all the remaining players lose simultaneously and one is larger than the rest, they win. Otherwise, it's a tie.

**TIPS**  
Block in other snakes to make them lose. If only two players are alive, the winning player can crash into the other head-on to win (called _headhunting_).
